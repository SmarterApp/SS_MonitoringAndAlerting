Design Doc TODO:
	Describe Async processes--on HQ Component Layered View?
		HypericAlertCreator
		HypericAutoApprover
		HypericMetricLoader
		HypericMetricRefresher
	Sequence Diagrams
		Alert: Search, Create (can create a Notification)
		Log: Search, Create (can create a Notification)
		Metric: Create (includes creation of MetricInfo in JMX), get, search
		NotificationGroup: Create, Update, Get, Search, Delete
		NotificationRule: Create, Update, Get, Search, Delete
		ReferenceController: lookups registered servers, components, severity levels, alert types
		Show how JMX project works:
			Registration--create, get (by id, alternate key), update, remove
			MetricInfo-- create, get (by id, alternate key),, 
		Client Interaction (perhaps show client jar)
			AOP performance (creates Performance metric)
			Availability (Health metric)
			AbstractController (Fault Barrier and logging--creates log)
